Description:
This program determines the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle based the nearest angle in degrees and the length of the adjacent side


Variables:
angleDegrees
adjacentSide
angleRadians
hypotenuse


Functions:
calculateHypotenuse
main


Logical Steps:

1. Import math class

2. Define calculateHypotenuse function

3. Take user input

4. Convert the angle from degrees to radians

5. Calculate the hypotenuse

6. Return the calculated hypotenuse

7. Define main function

8. Prompt the user for the nearest angle and the adjacent side length

9. Call calculateHypotenuse to compute the hypotenuse

10. Print the length of the hypotenuse to two decimal places
