Description:
This program creates a SQLite database to store and simulate population growth data for 10 cities in Florida over 20 years, then allows the user to visualize the population growth of a selected city


Variables:
conn
cursor
cities
initial_population
growth_rate
rows
city
population
year
choice
selected_city
years
populations


Functions:
createDatabaseAndTable
insertInitialData
simulatePopulationGrowth
showPopulationGrowth
main


Logical Steps:

1. Create a SQLite database called population_AS

2. Create a table named population with fields for city, year, and population

3. Insert data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023

4. Simulate population growth for the next 20 years at a 2% growth rate

5. Visualize the population growth for a user-selected city using Matplotlib
