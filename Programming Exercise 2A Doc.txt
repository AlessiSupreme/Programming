Description:
This program checks the probability of an email message being spam by looking at common spam keywords. The user gives a string as their message, and it examines this string to see if it contains any of the 30 set up spam keywords.


Variables:
SPAMKEYWORDS 
spamScore
emailMessage
likelihood
percentage
matchedKeywords


Functions:
getScore(message)
getLikelihood(score)
getPercentage(score)
reDo(answer)
main()


Logical Steps:
1. Define the list of spam keywords 

2. Create a function to get score

- For each keyword in SPAMKEYWORDS, check if it is present in the message, 
- if a keyword is found, increment spamScore by 1 and add the keyword to matchedKeywords

3. Create a function to get spam likelihood

- Based on the value of spamScore, determine the likelihood of the message being spam

3. Create a function to get likelihood percentage

- Based on the value of spamScore, determine the percentage of likelihood of the message being spam

3. Create a function to check for code redo

- Based on user input, determine whether to start code over or exit

4. Create the main function:

- Prompt user for an email message and store it,
- call getScore to get spamScore and matchedKeywords,
- call getLikelihood to get the likelihood,
- call getPercentage to get the percentage,
- print all,
- prompt user for code redo

5. Execute the main function
