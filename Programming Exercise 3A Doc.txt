Description:
This program asks the user for expenses and their types and outputs the sum, max and min


Variables and Arrays (all local) per function:
addFunc
	fullList
	inputType
	expenseType
	sumItem
	minItem
	minIndex
	maxItem
	maxIndex
calculateTotal
	typeStr
	inStr
	expensesLength
	charIndex
	expenseItem
	lastChar
commaType
	expensesAmount
	itemIndex
	expensesListed
	lastChar
	inStr
oneByOneType
	expensesAmount
	itemIndex
	expensesListed
	typesListed
	expenseLength
	charIndex
	expenseItem
reDo
	answer
main
	listType
	expenseList
	typeList
	inputType


Functions:
addFunc(a, b)
calculateTotal(fullList, inputType, expenseType)
commaType()
oneByOneType()
reDo(answer)
main()


Logical Steps:
1. Define addFunc(a, b) function

- Add two numbers and return the result

2. Define calculateTotal(fullList, inputType, expenseType) function

- Calculate the sum of the expenses using reduce and addFunc
- Find the smallest expense and its index
- Find the biggest expense and its index
- Output the types
- Output the sum, highest, and lowest expenses
- Output the types of the highest and lowest expenses if inputType is 2

3. Define commaType() function

- Prompt the user for the type
- Prompt the user to input their list of expenses
- Convert the input string to a list of expenses
- Return the list of expenses and the type

4. Define oneByOneType() function

- Prompt the user for the number of expenses
- Set up variables for tracking expenses and types
- Allow the user to input each expense and its type one by one
- Convert the input string to a float
- Return the list of expenses and the list of types

5. Define reDo(answer) function

- If the user answers "y", restart the main process
- If the user answers "n", exit the program

6. Define main() function

- Prompt the user to choose an input method
- Call the appropriate function for list input
- Call calculateTotal to calculate and display the results
- Call reDo to ask the user if they want to redo the process

7. Execute Main
